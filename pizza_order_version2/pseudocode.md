####PSEUDOCODE 

On running the application, the user should be greeted with a welcome. 

The user will then be prompted to give the names of the people ording pizza's. This user response will then be pushed to an empty array. 

We then need to create a function. This function will ask the user What type of pizza they want (vegeterian or meat) and based on user input console.log a range of options pulled for either the meatPizza array or the vegetarianPizza array. The user option will then be pushed into either a meatOrder array or VegetarianOrder array. 

We need to create a function that determines how hungry a user is. This function will include a switch statement to determine how much pizza needs to be ordered for this user. Based on the users preferences, the selection will be pushed into different arrays, with different pizza amounts attached to them. 

For example, 

The array notReally will be equal to 1/4 of a pizza. 

The array somewhat will be equal to 1/2 of a pizza.

The array very will be equal to 3/4 of a pizza 

The array starving will be equal to a whole pizza. 

We need to create a function for garlic bread. 

The user will be asked if they want garlic bread, if they do, they will be asked to select from a number of choices. A whole, half, quarter. 

We need to create a function for drinks 

The user will be asked if they want a drink. If they select yes, then an array of drink options will be displayed to the user. 

We need to create a for loop for all of these function that iterates through for each user. This for loop should begin with a prompt for the user that's turn it is. 

For example, "Hey ${name} let's place your order!"

Once every user has selected their options, we should print out to the user what selections have been made and in what quantities. 

All of this data should then be simplified so that we return to the user something like the following. 

Dear ${name}, based on your preferences you should order, 5 meat pizzas, 2 vegetarian pizzas, 3 garlic breads a bottle of coke and a bottle of fanta! 

Based on your preferences we suggest the following 

Pizza 

Chilli, 
BBQ Chicken,
Supreme,

Meatlovers, 

Vegetarian Delight, 
Vegetarian Delight, 
Garlic Bread x {math operator}
and
